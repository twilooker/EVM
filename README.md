# EVM

This is python implementation for the project, mathematical theory of which can be accessed via link http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/. 
Taking just the video of the object standing still, this algorithm can reveal subtle changes (movement and colour), invisible for naked eye. 
In the result the video with enlarged movements and colour changes is produced.

You can read more detailed explanation in the publications from the source above.
